# Ensures that workspace dependencies are resolved via `path` and not something else.
# Also checks that all crates are part of the Rust workspace.

# Invocation:
#  python check-deps.py polkadot-sdk/
# Example output:
#  🔎 Checking folder polkadot-sdk/
#  📜 Found workspace manifest
#  📜 Found 441 crates in the workspace
#  ✅ All 5307 dependency links are correct
